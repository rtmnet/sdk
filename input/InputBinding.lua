-- 
-- Loads and saves action input bindings and provides action trigger information.
-- 
-- Methods of note (see the documentation of the actual methods for more detailed descriptions):
-- registerActionEvent()    Register an event callback for an action (for action values, see InputAction.lua)
-- removeActionEvent()      Removes a previously registered event. Also see removeActionEventsByTarget().
-- setActionEvent...()      Group of methods to adjust event states, e.g. activity or input display hint parameters.
-- 
-- Input event usage scenarios:
-- 1. Long lifetime components / much interaction: Register event at creation of a component, modify event in component
-- update method depending on its state, remove event at component destruction
-- 2. Short lifetime components / little interaction: Register event when necessary (e.g. when in range of an object),
-- remove again when no interaction is possible anymore
-- 
-- Player input settings are loaded from the file "inputBindings.xml" in their profile directory. If the file is not
-- present or corrupted whenever input is loaded, it will be restored from a suitable template. If a binding of a locked
-- action is changed directly on the file system, it will be overwritten with its template counterpart on the next
-- loading call to ensure that critical inputs are always available (e.g. menu navigation).
